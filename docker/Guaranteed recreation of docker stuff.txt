Guaranteed recreation of docker stuff:

In some cases even after deleting all images, containers and volumes, might happen, that
applciation from the container is still not updated. 

In that case these commands might help:

$ sudo docker-compose build --no-cache
$ sudo docker-compose up --force-recreate
